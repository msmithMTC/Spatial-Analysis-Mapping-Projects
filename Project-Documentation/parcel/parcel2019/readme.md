## Problem Statement

The purpose of this project is to create a 2019 parcel feature set for the San Francisco Bay Region. .

## Analysis Parameters

As part of this analysis process, we mapped NAICS 2 digit, 3 digit, and 4 digit codes to what we've defined as Supply Chain Roles. Similarly, we mapped NAICS 2 digit, 3 digit, and 4 digit codes to what we've defined as Goods Movement - Related Industries and Occuplations. Following are tables which group NAICS codes into classes.

### Goods Movement - Related Industries and Occupations

4. Unemployment Rate 

   In 2015, 10% of California residents in the labor force were unemployed. Areas where more than 10% of residents in the labor force are unemployed is considered a moderate to high share. 

   [2015 ACS Unemployment Data - California](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects/blob/master/Regional-Goods-Movement/data/ACS_15_5YR_B23025_with_ann.csv)

5. Workers without a College Degree

   In 2015, 64% of workers in California did not have a Bachelor's Degree or higher. Areas where more than 60% of workers do not have a college Degree is considered a moderate to high share. 

   [2015 ACS Educational Attainment and Employment Status Data - California](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects/blob/master/Regional-Goods-Movement/data/ACS_15_5YR_B23006_with_ann.csv)

6. Low Income Workers 

   In 2015, 50% of workers in California made $35,000 or less. Areas where more than 50% of workers make less than $35,000 is considered a moderate to high share. The median income for a worker in California is $31,296 per year. Given the income is grouped into income brackets, the median income fell into the $25,000 to $34,999 range so anything below the top range was considered 'low income'.

#### Create Northern Claifornia Mega Region Employment Density Feature Classes

Two custom tools were created using ArcGIS Pro Model Builder to generate the final output feature class, as well as intermediary feature classes & rasters. The feature class generated highlights employment density within [FMMP Urban and Built Up](http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp/mccu/Pages/map_categories.aspx) areas. The toolbox containing the tools is linked below. Assumptions are maintained as defaults within the tools.

Output: 

This process created 9 output rasters, each following a patterned naming convention followed by the goods movement or supply chain class to to disambiguate each feature. Examples of that convention are provided below. These are intermediate features, which will were reclassified and converted from raster to polygon in the following process.

Input: 

This process was not integrated into the last process as each of the input rasters to the process needed to be classified seperately. Reclassification tables were created for each reclass feature and are referenced below. the 9 output rasters created from the previous process were input into this tool, each following a patterend naming convention followed by the goods movement or supply chain class. 

- [NC_Megaregion_Emp_Density_GoodsMvmtClass (Raster)](#feature-classes--csvs)
- [NC_Megaregion_Emp_Density_SupplyChainClass (Raster)](#feature-classes--csvs)

Tool Input Values: 

Each raster was reclassified, creating classes by standard deviation values. Those values were stored in tables for reference each following a pattered naming convention followed by the goods movement or supply chain class to disambiguate each feature.
Examples of that convention are provided below.

- [Reclass_Table_GoodsMvmtClass](#feature-classes--csvs)
- [Reclass_Table_SupplyChainClass](#feature-classes--csvs)

Output: 

This process created 9 output vector feature classes, each following a patterned naming convention followed by the goods movement or supply chain class and 'rc' or reclassifed to to disambiguate each feature. Examples of that convention are provided below.
