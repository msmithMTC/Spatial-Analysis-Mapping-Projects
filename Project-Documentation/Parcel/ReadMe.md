## Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to create 2019 parcel feature sets for the San Francisco Bay Region and each of its nine counties. 


## Data Sources 
All datasets downloaded on August 26, 2019

## Analysis Parameters

As part of the development of these feature sets, the number of parcel attributes was kept to a minimum. The final attribute tables have the following fields:
  * **joinid** - Identification value for joining external tables to parcel features. These values were generated by the MTC.
  
  * **fipco** - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for the county containing the parcel. Format of values matches the county designations from the agency's TomTom base data - CA###.
  
  * **jurisdict** - Incorporated jurisdiction containing the parcel. Parcels outside incorporated jurisdiction boundaries were labeled using the following format - "Unincorporated _countyName_"
  
  * **apn** - Unformatted Assessor's Parcel Number (APN)
  
  * **apn_frm** - Formatted APN
  
  * **acres** - Parcel size in gross acres
  
  * **wtrprcl** - Identifies whether parcel is on land or in water (this field is only included in the regional feature set on Socrata)




## Methodology 

***Process County Feature Sets***
1. [Create Northern California Megaregion Businesses FC](#create-northern-california-megaregion-business-fc)

   - [Create Northern California Megaregion Business FC Script](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects/blob/master/Regional-Goods-Movement/scripts/Python/Create_Northern_CA_Megaregion_Businesses_2016_FC.py)

2. [Create Nothern California Megaregion Employment Density Feature Classes](#create-northern-claifornia-mega-region-employment-density-feature-classes)
  
3. [Employment Summary by Goods Movement Class / Supply Chain Class](#employment-summary-by-goods-movement-class--supply-chain-class) 


***Assemble Regional Feature Sets***

Blah, blah, blah


## Expected Outcomes
The expectation was there would be blah, blah, blah
